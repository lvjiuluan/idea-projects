To validate the effectiveness of our method for participants sample generation, based on Experiment 1, we compare FedPSG-CAG with local generation methods in Party B. The baseline models used for comparison are the current state-of-the-art models in the field of data generation: CTGAN [9], TableGAN [10], CTAB-GAN [11], TVAE [9], and TabDDPM [14]. This experiment is also conducted with varying MisR-B. The evaluation metric for this experiment is RMSE. 

In FedPSG-CAG, Cum is set to 5, TabDDPM is still used as the generation model, and the federated imputation models are VF-GAIN and VF-VGAIN, which performed relatively better in Experiment 1. When Cum = 5, our method is denoted as FedPSG-CAG-5. In this experiment, the total number of training iterations for each generation method is set to 10,000, with 10 epochs, a learning rate of 0.001, and the Adam optimizer. 

The first group of experiments is conducted on the two datasets, 'Bank' and 'Credit'. As shown in Table 3, under the different values of MisR-B, the RMSE values of TabDDPM are superior when the generation model is used locally to generate samples for Party B. In the two datasets, when MisR-B is relatively high, FedPSG-CAG-0, i.e., Cum = 0, is superior to methods where the missing samples are generated by local generation models in Party B. 

However, when MisR-B is relatively low, local generation models in Party B can better learn the distribution of local data for generating the missing samples. However, regardless of whether the MisR-B is high or low, the RMSE of FedPSG-CAG-5 is superior to all the methods in which the missing samples are generated by local generation models in Party B and the method FedPSG-CAG-0. 

These results further confirm the effectiveness of our method, which first generates highly correlated attributes and then imputes the remaining attributes using vertical federated imputation models.

The second group of experiments is conducted on 'Letter' and 'News' datasets, which were mentioned in Section 4.1. Excluding the financial domain, Letter and News represent different application scenarios as well as different sample sizes and feature numbers. These two datasets equally divide the attribute columns between Parties A and B to simulate the vertical federated scenario. The data correlation, sample size, and number of attribute columns differ from those in 'Bank' and 'Credit' datasets. 

Therefore, Cnum = 5 is not necessarily the optimal setting for FedPSG-CAG. As shown in Table 4, across different values of MisR-B, TabDDPM consistently achieves lower RMSE values compared to other local generation models. However, the RMSE of FedPSG-CAG based on VF-GANs outperforms all models in which the missing samples are generated locally in Party B.
