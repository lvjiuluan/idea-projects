\subsubsection{RQ3: Uncovering hidden positive samples: VFPU vs. other semi-supervised methods in VFL Setting}

To assess the effectiveness of our method in addressing the UDD-PU problem, we conducted two experiments to compare it with other semi-supervised learning methods. The first experiment identifies the most effective semi-supervised methods for solving PU problems, which serve as the foundation for UDD-PU problems but without federation. The second experiment compares the top four semi-supervised methods from the first experiment in addressing the UDD-PU problem in VFL.


In the first experiment, we compared No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT with other 9 semi-supervised learning methods without federation, and the results are presented in \autoref{RQ3.1}. The compared methods include a direct application of GBDT \cite{elkan2008learning} (denoted as \_GBDT), Bagging\_GBDT \cite{mordelet2014bagging}, 2Step\_GBDT \cite{liu2003building}, Pseudo-labeling \cite{lee2013pseudo}, MixMatch \cite{berthelot2019mixmatch},  FixMatch \cite{sohn2020fixmatch}, CoMatch \cite{li2021comatch}, AdaMatch \cite{berthelot2021adamatch} and SoftMatch \cite{chen2023softmatch}.
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{\_GBDT:} directly applies a GBDT classifier to the PU data with unlabeled data (U) treated as negative samples and labeled data (P) treated as positive samples.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Bagging\_GBDT:} an ensemble method that utilizes the bagging technique for PU learning. It repeatedly samples from the unlabeled dataset to create diverse training sets, each containing a mixture of positive and unlabeled samples. A GBDT classifier is trained on each of these sets and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all classifiers.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{2Step\_GBDT:} firstly, trains a GBDT classifier on the positive and unlabeled samples, treating all unlabeled samples as negative. In the second step, the GBDT classifier is retrained on a subset of the unlabeled data that is most likely to contain hidden positive samples, identified based on their predicted probabilities in the first step.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Pseudo-labeling:} a semi-supervised learning technique that involves using the predictions of a model on unlabeled data to create pseudo-labels for that data. These pseudo-labels are then combined with the labeled data to train a new model or improve the existing model.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{MixMatch:} guesses low-entropy labels for data-augmented unlabeled examples and mixes labeled and unlabeled data using MixUp \cite{zhang2017mixup}. We set $T = 0.5$ and $K = 2$.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{FixMatch:} is the upgraded version of Pseudo Labeling. FixMatch turns the predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled data into hard 'one-hot' pseudo-labels and then further uses them as the learning signal of strongly-augmented unlabeled data. We use a set of hyperparameters($\tau = 0.95, \nu = 7, B = 64$).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{CoMatch:} learns two representations of training data, class probabilities and low dimensional embeddings, which interact with each other to improve pseudo-labels through a smoothness constraint and regularize the structure of the embeddings using graph-based contrastive learning. We follow FixMatch \cite{sohn2020fixmatch} and set the same hyperparameters.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{AdaMatch:} is proposed mainly for domain adaption, but can also adapted to SSL. It is characterized by relative threshold and distribution alignment, where the relative threshold is adaptively estimated from EMA \cite{tarvainen2017mean} of the confidence on labeled data. The confidence threshold $\tau$ is set to 0.9.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{SoftMatch:} maintains both high quantity and quality of pseudo-labels during training, weighting samples based on their confidence through a truncated Gaussian function, and enhances the utilization of weakly-learned classes with a uniform alignment approach. We set $m$ to 0.999 and divide the estimated variance ${{\hat \sigma }_t}{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}$ by 4 for $2\sigma$ of the Gaussian function.
\end{quote}

 In the first experiment, we scored all unlabeled samples using a classifier, and these scores represented the probability that the sample would be predicted as positive. We then ranked these scores and labeled the higher ranked samples as top-rated. The number of unlabeled samples chosen from top-rated is denoted as $num$ as shown in \autoref{RQ3.1}. We set the coefficient of the L2 penalty term to 0.4, the learning rate to 0.0002, and the batch size to 32 for the LR algorithm. For decision tree algorithms, the number of trees is set to 500, and the tree depth is set to 12. The learning rate is set to 0.02. We use the Wide ResNet-28 model from \cite{oliver2018realistic} for FixMatch, CoMatch, AdaMatch, and SoftMatch.

\autoref{RQ3.1} demonstrates that our method No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT outperforms other nine semi-supervised methods across all datasets and different $num$ in uncovering hidden positive samples without federation. For instance, on the Census dataset, when $num=1000$, in the term methods, No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT achieves the highest recommendation accuracy of 99\%. This is followed by \_GBDT, 2Step\_GBDT, and Baggin\_GBDT with accuracies of 64\%, 62\%, and 55\% respectively. The recommendation accuracies for MixMatch, FixMatch, CoMatch, AdaMatch, and SoftMatch are 35.94\%, 37.06\%, 33.39\%, 37.28\%, and 35.86\% respectively.

The Match series algorithms (FixMatch, CoMatch, AdaMatch, and SoftMatch), despite being the most recent, underperform compared to other semi-supervised learning methods in solving the PU problem. The reason for the underperformance could be: a) these methods still require labeled data for negative samples which are absent in the PU problem; b) these methods chose wide-resnet, a complex deep learning network, which may induce overfitting in data with extremely unbalanced samples.


The PU learning methods (VFPU\_GBDT, \_GBDT, Bagging\_GBDT, 2Step\_GBDT) in our specific scenario are capable of uncovering more potential positive samples. The top four methods as illustrated in \autoref{RQ3.1} are \_GBDT, Bagging\_GBDT, 2Step\_GBDT and VFPU\_GBDT. 
  第3部分
In the second experiment, we adapted the top four methods from the first experiment for a Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) setting, denoted as VF\_GBDT, VF\_Bagging\_GBDT, VF\_2Step\_GBDT, and VFPU\_GBDT. Meanwhile, to evaluate the time complexity of these methods in VFL setting, we recorded the training time for each method across diverse datasets when $num = 2400$. The traning time is denoted as runtime(s), with 's' indicating seconds in \autoref{RQ3.2}.
 

\autoref{RQ3.2}, similar to \autoref{RQ3.1}, compares the accuracy percentages of different methods but  in the VFL setting. The results in \autoref{RQ3.2} clearly show that the VFPU\_GBDT method surpasses other methods. For example, on the Census dataset, with $num=1000$, VFPU\_GBDT achieves a high recommendation accuracy of 98.70\%, significantly outperforming VF\_GBDT, VF\_Bagging\_GBDT, and VF\_2Step\_GBDT, which achieve accuracies of 24.20\%, 21.10\%, and 24.30\% respectively. On the Credit dataset, our method had a runtime of 107075.9s, while the runtimes for the other three methods were 12025.47s, 15791.59s, and 46954.19s respectively.
VFPU\_GBDT is approximately 10 times more time-consuming than other methods in terms of the metric of runtime(s). This is because VFPU adopts a more cautious strategy in selecting reliable positive samples through multiple iterations, and selecting only a small portion in each iteration. So there is a trade-off between the training time and the accuracy of the recommandation, and this time overhead is absolutely acceptable since the accuracy is significantly improved.

\autoref{fig:GBDT} visualizes the results of the Bank Marketing Dataset in \autoref{RQ3.2}. In \autoref{fig:GBDT}, the x-axis represents the varying amounts of top-rated unlabeled samples chosen as reliable positive samples. The y-axis denotes the percentage of these selected samples that are truly positive. The figure shows that the number of hidden positive samples identified by VFPU\_GBDT decreases rapidly as $num$ ranges from 100 to 1000. This decrease is attributed to several factors. First, unlabeled data samples that exhibit apparent similarity or difference form the positive samples are easily identified quickly. Then, the rest unlabeled data thatexhibit feature overlap between both classes introduce more interference to the classifier. This interference leads to misclassification and the percentage of accurate recommendation decreases. While other methods appear relatively stable, this stability is not necessarily advantageous. The accurate recommnedation percentage of other methods in identifying hidden positive samples is generally low. Regardless of the quantity of unlabeled samples selected from the top rated, they consistently fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy. In the experiment setup, there are only about 2500 true positive samples in this unlabeled dataset. Therefore, the accuracy of VFPU\_GBDT is decreasing when the number of selected positive samples exceeds 2500.
 
In summary, the effectiveness of the VFPU\_GBDT algorithm in recommending reliable positive samples in a VFL environment outperforms other semi-supervised methods. This experiment highlights the benefits of using the VFPU\_GBDT algorithm to address the unlabeled data-deficient PU (UDD-PU) learning recommendation problem in a federated learning environment.

\subsubsection{RQ3: Uncovering hidden positive samples: VFPU vs. other semi-supervised methods in VFL Setting}

In this section, we describe a comprehensive investigation designed to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method for addressing the UDD-PU problem, particularly within a vertical federated learning (VFL) setting. To achieve a rigorous analysis, we conducted two distinct experiments. The first experiment aims to identify the most effective semi-supervised learning methods for solving positive-unlabeled (PU) problems. These methods have been widely applied as a foundation for the UDD-PU problem but are typically considered in non-federated settings. The second experiment builds upon the outcomes of the first by comparing the top four semi-supervised techniques in the context of UDD-PU problems when implemented in a VFL environment.

In the first experiment, we perform a detailed comparison between our No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT approach and nine other well-established semi-supervised learning methods that operate without federation. The results of this comparison are comprehensively presented in \autoref{RQ3.1}. The following paragraphs provide additional background and elaborate on the methodology behind each method included in the study.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{\_GBDT:} This method involves the direct application of a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) classifier to the positive-unlabeled (PU) dataset. In this approach, unlabeled data (denoted as U) are treated as negative samples, while the available labeled data (P) are considered positive. This baseline method serves as a starting point to evaluate the inherent challenges associated with PU learning when conventional techniques are applied without any special handling for the hidden positive samples.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Bagging\_GBDT:} Bagging\_GBDT represents an ensemble learning approach that leverages the bagging technique for PU learning. In this method, multiple training sets are created by repeatedly sampling from the unlabeled dataset. Each training set includes a mixture of positive and unlabeled samples, thereby generating diverse subsets on which individual GBDT classifiers are trained. The final prediction is derived by averaging the predictions from all classifiers in the ensemble. This method is designed to reduce variance and improve the robustness of predictions by integrating multiple models.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{2Step\_GBDT:} The 2Step\_GBDT approach introduces a two-phase training process. In the initial phase, a GBDT classifier is trained on the complete PU dataset, where all unlabeled samples are temporarily treated as negative. Subsequently, the classifier is used to identify a subset of unlabeled samples that exhibit high likelihoods of being positive. In the second phase, the classifier is retrained using this refined subset to enhance its ability to distinguish hidden positive samples from actual negatives. This iterative refinement is critical for improving classification performance in settings where positive samples are obscured within large unlabeled populations.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Pseudo-labeling:} Pseudo-labeling is a well-known semi-supervised learning technique that leverages the model’s predictions on unlabeled data to generate pseudo-labels. These pseudo-labels are then combined with the original labeled data to either retrain the model or enhance the existing model’s learning process. The core idea behind pseudo-labeling is to iteratively improve the model by treating high-confidence predictions as ground truth, thereby gradually incorporating more information from the unlabeled data into the training regime.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{MixMatch:} MixMatch is a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning method that employs a combination of label guessing for augmented unlabeled examples and the mixing of both labeled and unlabeled data using the MixUp technique \cite{zhang2017mixup}. In our experiments, we set the temperature parameter $T$ to 0.5 and the number of augmentations $K$ to 2. This method is designed to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model by effectively utilizing unlabeled data to generate smoother decision boundaries.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{FixMatch:} FixMatch is an enhanced version of the pseudo-labeling approach, which converts predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled data into hard, one-hot pseudo-labels. These pseudo-labels are then used as the learning signal for strongly-augmented unlabeled data. In our implementation, we use a set of hyperparameters including a confidence threshold $\tau = 0.95$, a parameter $\nu = 7$, and a batch size $B = 64$. The primary advantage of FixMatch lies in its ability to leverage consistency regularization, thereby making more effective use of the unlabeled dataset.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{CoMatch:} CoMatch extends the idea of FixMatch by incorporating two complementary representations of the training data. It simultaneously learns class probabilities and low-dimensional embeddings, which interact to refine the quality of pseudo-labels through a smoothness constraint. Additionally, CoMatch regularizes the structure of the embeddings using graph-based contrastive learning. For consistency and comparison, we follow the same hyperparameter settings as used in FixMatch \cite{sohn2020fixmatch}. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where the underlying data distribution is complex and multi-modal.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{AdaMatch:} Originally proposed for domain adaptation tasks, AdaMatch has been adapted for use in semi-supervised learning. Its key features include the relative threshold and distribution alignment mechanisms. The relative threshold is adaptively estimated using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the confidence scores on the labeled data \cite{tarvainen2017mean}. In our experiments, the confidence threshold is set to $\tau = 0.9$. AdaMatch’s adaptive strategy helps to better balance the contributions of labeled and unlabeled data, thus making it a strong candidate for tasks involving imbalanced datasets.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{SoftMatch:} SoftMatch is designed to maintain both a high quantity and quality of pseudo-labels during the training process. It achieves this by weighting samples according to their confidence scores through a truncated Gaussian function. Additionally, SoftMatch enhances the learning of classes that are weakly represented by using a uniform alignment approach. In our experiments, we set the parameter $m$ to 0.999 and adjust the estimated variance ${{\hat \sigma }_t}$ by dividing it by 4, corresponding to a $2\sigma$ interval of the Gaussian function. This method aims to alleviate the common challenges associated with noisy pseudo-labels, ensuring that only the most reliable information is incorporated into the training process.
\end{quote}

By enriching the explanation and providing a detailed account of each method’s working principles and hyperparameter settings, we aim to furnish a deeper understanding of the comparative strengths and limitations of these approaches. Such an exhaustive comparison not only highlights the robustness of the No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT method in uncovering hidden positive samples but also serves as a benchmark for future research in addressing the UDD-PU problem within both conventional and federated learning frameworks.

第2部分
In the first experiment, we scored all unlabeled samples using a classifier, and these scores represented the probability that a given sample would be predicted as positive. The scoring process involved applying a calibrated model to compute the likelihood that each unlabeled instance belongs to the positive class. After obtaining these probability scores, we ranked all unlabeled samples in descending order, and the samples with the highest scores were subsequently labeled as top-rated. The number of unlabeled samples selected from the top of this ranking is denoted as $num$, as shown in \autoref{RQ3.1}.

For the logistic regression (LR) algorithm used in this experiment, we meticulously set the coefficient of the L2 penalty term to 0.4, the learning rate to 0.0002, and the batch size to 32. These hyperparameter settings were chosen based on preliminary experiments that indicated they offered a balanced trade-off between convergence stability and computational efficiency. In the case of decision tree-based algorithms, particularly those employing gradient boosting, we set the number of trees to 500 and fixed the maximum tree depth to 12. Additionally, the learning rate for the decision tree algorithms was set to 0.02. Such hyperparameter configurations were critical to ensure that the models were sufficiently expressive to capture complex patterns in the data while mitigating risks of overfitting.

Moreover, for the Match series algorithms—namely FixMatch, CoMatch, AdaMatch, and SoftMatch—we employed the Wide ResNet-28 model from \cite{oliver2018realistic}. This model is recognized for its robust feature extraction capabilities in semi-supervised settings. However, the choice of this deep learning architecture introduces a layer of complexity that can lead to overfitting, especially in scenarios where the data is extremely unbalanced, as is common in PU problems.

\autoref{RQ3.1} demonstrates that our proposed method, No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT, consistently outperforms the other nine semi-supervised methods across all tested datasets and for various values of $num$. For example, on the Census dataset, when $num=1000$, our method achieves the highest recommendation accuracy of 99\%. This remarkable performance is in stark contrast with the results obtained by the baseline methods, where \_GBDT, 2Step\_GBDT, and Bagging\_GBDT achieve accuracies of 64\%, 62\%, and 55\% respectively. Meanwhile, the recommendation accuracies for the deep learning-based approaches—MixMatch, FixMatch, CoMatch, AdaMatch, and SoftMatch—are significantly lower at 35.94\%, 37.06\%, 33.39\%, 37.28\%, and 35.86\% respectively.

The underperformance of the Match series algorithms, despite being the most recent advancements in semi-supervised learning, can be attributed to two key factors. First, these methods inherently require a substantial amount of labeled data for both the positive and negative classes. However, in the PU problem setting, negative samples are not explicitly labeled, which places these algorithms at a distinct disadvantage. Second, the utilization of the Wide ResNet-28 model—a relatively complex deep learning network—may inadvertently lead to overfitting when trained on datasets with a highly unbalanced class distribution. This overfitting can degrade the model’s generalization capability, resulting in lower overall performance.

In contrast, the PU learning methods, including VFPU\_GBDT, \_GBDT, Bagging\_GBDT, and 2Step\_GBDT, are specifically designed to address the challenge of uncovering hidden positive samples within a predominantly unlabeled dataset. These methods capitalize on the inherent structure of the data and employ tailored strategies to iteratively refine the identification of potential positive instances. As a result, the top four performing methods, as illustrated in \autoref{RQ3.1}, are \_GBDT, Bagging\_GBDT, 2Step\_GBDT, and VFPU\_GBDT. Their superior performance highlights the effectiveness of PU learning strategies in scenarios where negative samples are not directly available and the data exhibits significant imbalance.

By enriching our analysis with detailed discussions of the scoring mechanisms, hyperparameter settings, and underlying model architectures, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the experimental setup and the relative merits of each method. This detailed exposition underscores the advantages of our No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT approach in effectively uncovering hidden positive samples, thereby offering valuable insights for future research in both conventional and federated PU learning frameworks.

In the second experiment, we adapted the top four methods from the first experiment for a Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) setting, denoted as VF\_GBDT, VF\_Bagging\_GBDT, VF\_2Step\_GBDT, and VFPU\_GBDT. In addition, to evaluate the time complexity and computational overhead of these methods when deployed in a VFL environment, we carefully recorded the training time for each method across diverse datasets with $num = 2400$. The training time is denoted as runtime(s), where 's' stands for seconds, as detailed in \autoref{RQ3.2}.

\autoref{RQ3.2}, analogous to \autoref{RQ3.1}, presents a comparative analysis of the accuracy percentages achieved by the different methods under the VFL setting. The results clearly demonstrate that the VFPU\_GBDT method consistently outperforms the other three methods in terms of recommendation accuracy. For instance, on the Census dataset, when $num=1000$, VFPU\_GBDT achieves a remarkably high recommendation accuracy of 98.70\%, which is significantly higher than the accuracies of VF\_GBDT, VF\_Bagging\_GBDT, and VF\_2Step\_GBDT, which are reported to be 24.20\%, 21.10\%, and 24.30\% respectively. On the Credit dataset, although VFPU\_GBDT demonstrates superior accuracy, it comes with an increased computational cost: our method records a runtime of 107075.9s, whereas the runtimes for VF\_GBDT, VF\_Bagging\_GBDT, and VF\_2Step\_GBDT are 12025.47s, 15791.59s, and 46954.19s respectively.

It is important to note that VFPU\_GBDT is approximately 10 times more time-consuming than the other methods when measured by the runtime(s) metric. This increased time consumption is primarily due to the more cautious and iterative strategy adopted by VFPU\_GBDT in selecting reliable positive samples. The algorithm employs multiple iterations and selects only a small portion of the samples in each iteration, ensuring that only the most reliable and accurately predicted positive samples are chosen. This careful selection process introduces additional computational overhead. However, this trade-off between training time and recommendation accuracy is deemed acceptable, as the significant improvement in accuracy justifies the additional time required for training.

\autoref{fig:GBDT} provides a visual representation of the experimental results on the Bank Marketing Dataset, as discussed in \autoref{RQ3.2}. In this figure, the x-axis represents the varying amounts of top-rated unlabeled samples that are chosen as reliable positive samples, while the y-axis denotes the percentage of these selected samples that are truly positive. The figure clearly illustrates that the number of hidden positive samples identified by VFPU\_GBDT decreases rapidly as $num$ increases from 100 to 1000. This observed decrease can be attributed to several factors. Initially, unlabeled data samples that exhibit strong similarity to the positive class or clear differences from the negative class are quickly identified and selected. However, as the selection process continues, the remaining unlabeled data tend to exhibit feature overlaps between the positive and negative classes, which introduces interference to the classifier. This interference results in misclassification, thereby reducing the percentage of accurate recommendations. Although the other methods show relatively stable performance across different values of $num$, this apparent stability is not necessarily advantageous. The consistently low accurate recommendation percentages achieved by these methods indicate their limited ability to identify hidden positive samples reliably. Furthermore, given that there are only about 2500 true positive samples in the unlabeled dataset, the accuracy of VFPU\_GBDT naturally decreases when the number of selected positive samples exceeds this threshold.

In summary, the experimental results provide strong evidence that the VFPU\_GBDT algorithm is highly effective in recommending reliable positive samples within a VFL environment. Despite the additional computational time required, the substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy make VFPU\_GBDT a superior approach compared to other semi-supervised methods. This experiment highlights the significant benefits of employing the VFPU\_GBDT algorithm to address the unlabeled data-deficient PU (UDD-PU) learning recommendation problem in a federated learning context, underscoring its potential for practical applications where high accuracy is paramount.

\subsubsection{RQ3: 揭示隐含正样本：VFPU 与其他垂直联邦学习环境中的半监督方法对比}

在本节中，我们对所提出的针对UDD-PU问题的方法进行了全面探讨，特别是在垂直联邦学习（VFL）的设定下，为评估该方法的有效性设计了严谨的分析。为此，我们开展了两个不同的实验。第一个实验旨在识别最有效的解决正-未标记（PU）问题的半监督学习方法。这些方法虽广泛应用于UDD-PU问题的研究，但通常是在非联邦环境下考虑。第二个实验则基于第一个实验的结果，将前四种半监督技术在实现UDD-PU问题的VFL环境中进行比较。

在第一个实验中，我们对比了我们的No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT方法与另外九种在非联邦环境下运行的知名半监督学习方法。该对比结果在\autoref{RQ3.1}中进行了全面展示。以下段落进一步介绍了每种方法的背景及其在本研究中的具体实现细节。

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{\_GBDT:} 此方法涉及直接将梯度提升决策树（GBDT）分类器应用于正-未标记（PU）数据集。在这种方法中，未标记的数据（记为U）被当作负样本，而现有的标记数据（P）被视为正样本。这一基线方法为评估在没有特殊处理隐藏正样本的情况下，传统技术在PU学习中所面临的内在挑战提供了参考。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Bagging\_GBDT:} Bagging\_GBDT代表了一种利用装袋（bagging）技术进行PU学习的集成学习方法。在这种方法中，通过对未标记数据集的反复采样生成多个训练集。每个训练集都包含正样本和未标记样本的混合，从而生成一系列多样化的子集，并在其上分别训练独立的GBDT分类器。最终的预测结果由所有分类器的预测平均值决定。该方法旨在通过整合多个模型来降低方差并提高预测的鲁棒性。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{2Step\_GBDT:} 2Step\_GBDT方法引入了一个两阶段的训练过程。在第一阶段，使用完整的PU数据集训练GBDT分类器，此时所有未标记样本暂时被当作负样本。随后，该分类器被用来识别一部分具有高正样本可能性的未标记样本。在第二阶段，利用这一精炼后的样本子集对分类器进行再训练，以提高其区分隐藏正样本与真实负样本的能力。此迭代细化过程对于在正样本被大量未标记样本掩盖的情况下提升分类性能至关重要。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Pseudo-labeling:} Pseudo-labeling是一种著名的半监督学习技术，它利用模型对未标记数据的预测生成伪标签。接着，将这些伪标签与原有的标记数据结合，用于重新训练模型或提升现有模型的学习过程。伪标签方法的核心思想是，通过将高置信度的预测视为真实标签，使模型不断迭代改进，从而逐步将未标记数据信息整合进训练过程。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{MixMatch:} MixMatch是当前领先的半监督学习方法，通过对未标记样本进行增强后猜测标签，并利用MixUp技术混合标记和未标记数据而实现。在我们的实验中，我们将温度参数$T$设置为0.5，将增强次数$K$设置为2。该方法旨在通过有效利用未标记数据生成更平滑的决策边界，从而减少过拟合并提升模型的泛化能力。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{FixMatch:} FixMatch是伪标签方法的增强版本，它将对弱增强未标记数据的预测结果转换为硬性的一热编码伪标签，然后利用这些伪标签作为对强增强未标记数据的学习信号。在我们的实现中，我们采用一组超参数，包括置信阈值$\tau = 0.95$，参数$\nu = 7$，以及批次大小$B = 64$。FixMatch的主要优势在于其利用一致性正则化的能力，从而更为有效地利用未标记数据集。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{CoMatch:} CoMatch通过同时引入训练数据的两种互补表示扩展了FixMatch的思想。它同时学习类别概率和低维嵌入，两者相互作用以通过平滑约束来提升伪标签的质量。同时，CoMatch利用基于图的对比学习来正则化嵌入结构。为了保证一致性和便于比较，我们遵循与FixMatch相同的超参数设置 \cite{sohn2020fixmatch}。这一方法在底层数据分布复杂且呈多模态情况时尤为有效。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{AdaMatch:} AdaMatch最初为领域适应任务提出，并被改进用于半监督学习。其核心特性包括相对阈值和分布对齐机制。相对阈值通过对标记数据置信度分数的指数移动平均（EMA）自适应估计 \cite{tarvainen2017mean}。在我们的实验中，置信阈值设置为$\tau = 0.9$。AdaMatch的自适应策略有助于更好地平衡标记数据和未标记数据的贡献，从而使其成为处理样本不平衡数据集任务的有力候选方法。
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{SoftMatch:} SoftMatch旨在在训练过程中同时保持伪标签的数量和质量。它通过使用截断高斯函数对样本按照其置信度分数进行加权来实现这一目标。此外，SoftMatch采用均匀对齐方法来增强对代表性较弱类别的学习。在我们的实验中，我们将参数$m$设置为0.999，并将估计方差${{\hat \sigma }_t}$除以4，对应于高斯函数的$2\sigma$区间。该方法旨在缓解噪声伪标签所带来的常见挑战，确保只有最为可靠的信息被纳入训练过程中。
\end{quote}

通过对各方法工作原理和超参数设置的详细说明，我们旨在提供对这些方法各自优势和局限性的深入理解。这一详尽的比较不仅突显了No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT方法在揭示隐藏正样本方面的鲁棒性，同时也为未来在常规和联邦学习框架下解决UDD-PU问题的研究提供了基准。
第2部分

在第一次实验中，我们使用分类器对所有未标记样本进行了打分，这些分数代表了某个样本被预测为正类的概率。打分过程采用了经过校准的模型，以计算每个未标记实例属于正类的可能性。获取这些概率分数后，我们将所有未标记样本按降序排序，并将分数最高的样本标记为顶级样本。图\autoref{RQ3.1}中所示的$ num $表示从该排名顶部选取的未标记样本数量。

对于本次实验中使用的逻辑回归（LR）算法，我们严格设置了L2惩罚项系数为0.4，学习率为0.0002，批量大小为32。这些超参数设置是基于初步实验结果选择的，表明它们在收敛稳定性与计算效率之间提供了较为平衡的权衡。对于基于决策树的算法，特别是采用梯度提升的方法，我们将树的数量设置为500，并将最大树深固定为12。此外，决策树算法的学习率设置为0.02。这些超参数配置对于确保模型能够充分表达数据中复杂模式，同时降低过拟合风险至关重要。

此外，对于Match系列算法——即FixMatch、CoMatch、AdaMatch和SoftMatch，我们采用了\cite{oliver2018realistic}中的Wide ResNet-28模型。该模型因其在半监督环境中具有强大的特征提取能力而受到认可。然而，选择这一深度学习架构引入了一定的复杂性，尤其是在数据极度不平衡的情况下（如PU问题中常见），这可能导致模型过拟合。

图\autoref{RQ3.1}显示，我们提出的No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT方法在所有测试数据集上以及对于各个不同的$num$值均持续优于其他九种半监督方法。例如，在Census数据集中，当$num=1000$时，我们的方法实现了最高的推荐准确率99\%。这一显著性能与基线方法形成了鲜明对比：\_GBDT、2Step\_GBDT和Bagging\_GBDT分别仅达到64\%、62\%和55\%的准确率。同时，基于深度学习的方法——MixMatch、FixMatch、CoMatch、AdaMatch和SoftMatch——的推荐准确率明显较低，分别为35.94\%、37.06\%、33.39\%、37.28\%和35.86\%。

Match系列算法尽管是半监督学习领域最新的进展，但表现不佳可以归因于两个关键因素。首先，这些方法本质上需要大量标记数据，涵盖正类和负类。然而，在PU问题情境下，负样本并未被明确标记，这使得这些算法处于明显的不利地位。其次，使用Wide ResNet-28模型这一相对复杂的深度学习网络，在面对类分布极度不平衡的数据集时，可能无意中导致过拟合。这种过拟合会削弱模型的泛化能力，从而导致整体性能较低。

相比之下，PU学习方法，包括VFPU\_GBDT、\_GBDT、Bagging\_GBDT和2Step\_GBDT，专门为解决在主要由未标记样本构成的数据集中揭示隐藏正样本这一挑战而设计。这些方法利用数据的内在结构，并采用定制的策略来迭代细化对潜在正实例的识别。因此，如\autoref{RQ3.1}所示，表现最好的四种方法分别为\_GBDT、Bagging\_GBDT、2Step\_GBDT和VFPU\_GBDT。它们的出色性能突显了PU学习策略在负样本不可直接获得且数据存在显著不平衡的情景中的有效性。

通过对打分机制、超参数设置以及底层模型架构的详细讨论，我们丰富了分析内容，从而全面理解了实验设置及各方法的相对优劣。这一详细论述凸显了我们提出的No\_Fed\_VFPU\_GBDT方法在有效揭示隐藏正样本方面的优势，为未来在常规PU学习和联邦PU学习框架下的研究提供了宝贵的启示。

在第二个实验中，我们将第一个实验中表现最佳的四种方法适配到垂直联邦学习（VFL）环境中，分别标记为VF\_GBDT、VF\_Bagging\_GBDT、VF\_2Step\_GBDT和VFPU\_GBDT。此外，为了评估这些方法在VFL环境中部署时的时间复杂度和计算开销，我们在$num = 2400$的各种数据集上仔细记录了每种方法的训练时间。训练时间表示为runtime(s)，其中's'代表秒，详细内容见\autoref{RQ3.2}。

\autoref{RQ3.2}与\autoref{RQ3.1}类似，展示了VFL设置下不同方法所达到的准确率百分比的比较分析。结果清晰地表明，VFPU\_GBDT方法在推荐准确率方面始终优于其他三种方法。例如，在Census数据集上，当$num=1000$时，VFPU\_GBDT达到了显著高的98.70\%的推荐准确率，这明显高于VF\_GBDT、VF\_Bagging\_GBDT和VF\_2Step\_GBDT的准确率，它们分别为24.20\%、21.10\%和24.30\%。在Credit数据集上，尽管VFPU\_GBDT展示了更高的准确率，但它带来了更高的计算成本：我们的方法记录的运行时间为107075.9s，而VF\_GBDT、VF\_Bagging\_GBDT和VF\_2Step\_GBDT的运行时间分别为12025.47s、15791.59s和46954.19s。

值得注意的是，按runtime(s)指标衡量，VFPU\_GBDT的耗时约为其他方法的10倍。这种增加的时间消耗主要是由于VFPU\_GBDT在选择可靠正样本时采用了更为谨慎和迭代的策略。该算法采用多次迭代，每次迭代只选择一小部分样本，确保只有最可靠和准确预测的正样本被选中。这种谨慎的选择过程引入了额外的计算开销。然而，这种训练时间与推荐准确率之间的权衡被认为是可接受的，因为准确率的显著提高证明了额外训练时间的合理性。

\autoref{fig:GBDT}提供了\autoref{RQ3.2}中讨论的银行营销数据集实验结果的可视化表示。在该图中，x轴表示被选为可靠正样本的评分最高的未标记样本数量，而y轴表示这些被选择样本中真正为正样本的百分比。图中清晰地说明，随着$num$从100增加到1000，VFPU\_GBDT识别的隐藏正样本数量迅速减少。这种观察到的减少可归因于几个因素。最初，与正类表现出强烈相似性或与负类有明显差异的未标记数据样本被迅速识别和选择。然而，随着选择过程的继续，剩余的未标记数据往往在正负类之间表现出特征重叠，这给分类器带来干扰。这种干扰导致错误分类，从而降低了准确推荐的百分比。虽然其他方法在不同$num$值下表现相对稳定，但这种表面上的稳定性并不一定是有利的。这些方法始终较低的准确推荐百分比表明它们在可靠识别隐藏正样本方面能力有限。此外，考虑到未标记数据集中只有约2500个真正的正样本，当选择的正样本数量超过这个阈值时，VFPU\_GBDT的准确率自然会下降。

总之，实验结果提供了强有力的证据，表明VFPU\_GBDT算法在VFL环境中推荐可靠正样本方面非常有效。尽管需要额外的计算时间，但推荐准确率的显著提升使VFPU\_GBDT相比其他半监督方法成为更优方案。这项实验突显了在联邦学习环境中应用VFPU\_GBDT算法解决未标记数据缺乏的PU（UDD-PU）学习推荐问题的显著优势，强调了它在高准确率至关重要的实际应用中的潜力。
