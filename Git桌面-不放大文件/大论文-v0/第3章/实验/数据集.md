\textbf{Datasets:} In our experiment, we utilized three datasets to evaluate our proposed method, including the Bank Marketing Dataset\footnote{\label{bank}\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing}}, the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset\footnote{\sloppy \label{credit}\url{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset}} and the Adult Census Dataset\footnote{\label{adult}\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult}}. The Bank Marketing Dataset is associated with the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were conducted through phone calls. It comprises four data sets, and we utilized the "bank-additional-full" dataset, which includes a total of 41,188 examples and 20 inputs/features. The data is ordered by date, spanning from May 2008 to November 2010. The classification goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit, represented by the variable "y". The Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset contains data on 30,000 credit card clients and 24 variables, including demographic and payment history information. This dataset is employed to construct predictive models for assessing the likelihood of a client defaulting on loan payments in the following month, indicated by a binary target variable denoting the defaulting status. The Adult Census Dataset is a collection of information about individuals in the United States based on the 1994 Census. It includes details such as age, education,occupation, and income. This dataset is used to predict whether someone earns over \$50,000 per year based on their characteristics. Researchers and machine learning practitioners utilize this dataset to evaluate new models and investigate social patterns related to income and employment. For simplicity, the terms 'Bank', 'Credit', and 'Census' are utilized to represent the three datasets, respectively.

In data preprocessing, categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding, while numerical features are normalized using standardized scaling.

Each dataset has already been partitioned into training sets and testing datasets by the data provider. We split the data vertically into three parts and distributed them to three parties A, B, and C. We removed the data labels from party B and party C to generate unlabeled data U. For party A, we selected 10\% of the data from the positive class as the positive set P and discarded all the rest of the positive and negative data.

In our experiment, we utilized three diverse and well-established datasets to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed method: the Bank Marketing Datasett\footnote{\label{bank}\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing}}, the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset\footnote{\sloppy \label{credit}\url{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset}} , and the Adult Census Dataset\footnote{\label{adult}\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult}}. Each dataset was carefully chosen to represent distinct real-world domains and predictive challenges, thereby enabling a robust assessment of our approach across varied contexts.

The Bank Marketing Dataset[^bank], sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, originates from the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These campaigns were strategically executed through phone calls aimed at persuading clients to subscribe to a term deposit product. The full dataset comprises four variations, but for this study, we specifically employed the "bank-additional-full" version, which encompasses a substantial collection of 41,188 examples and 20 input features. These features capture a wide range of client attributes, including age, job type, marital status, education level, and financial details such as the presence of housing or personal loans, as well as campaign-specific variables like the number of contacts and the outcome of previous interactions. The data is systematically ordered by date, spanning a period from May 2008 to November 2010, reflecting the temporal evolution of marketing efforts during this timeframe. The primary classification objective of this dataset is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, a binary outcome represented by the variable "y" (yes/no). This dataset is particularly noteworthy for its practical relevance in customer relationship management within the banking sector and its inherent class imbalance, where the majority of clients do not subscribe, presenting a meaningful challenge for predictive modeling.

The Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset[^credit], obtained from Kaggle, provides a comprehensive dataset detailing the financial behaviors of 30,000 credit card clients in Taiwan, characterized by 24 variables. These variables include a rich blend of demographic information—such as gender, education, marital status, and age—and extensive payment history data, encompassing monthly bill statements, amounts of previous payments, and records of payment delays across multiple months. This dataset serves as a foundation for constructing predictive models to assess the likelihood of a client defaulting on their loan payments in the subsequent month, with the target variable being a binary indicator of default status (yes/no). The combination of demographic and transactional features offers a nuanced perspective on credit risk, making this dataset highly valuable for financial analytics. Its substantial size and detailed feature set further enhance its suitability for training and evaluating sophisticated machine learning models aimed at credit risk prediction.

The Adult Census Dataset[^adult], also sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is a widely recognized collection of demographic and socio-economic data derived from the 1994 United States Census. It includes a variety of attributes such as age, workclass (e.g., private, federal government), education level, occupation, race, sex, capital gains, capital losses, hours worked per week, and native country, providing a detailed snapshot of individual characteristics. The dataset’s classification task is to predict whether an individual’s annual income exceeds $50,000, a binary outcome that serves as a benchmark for income prediction models. Beyond its utility in machine learning, this dataset is frequently employed by researchers and practitioners to explore social patterns related to income distribution, employment trends, and economic disparities. Its diverse feature set and real-world significance make it an ideal candidate for evaluating predictive models while also addressing challenges such as missing values and categorical data handling. For simplicity and consistency throughout the paper, we refer to these datasets as 'Bank', 'Credit', and 'Census', respectively.

In the data preprocessing phase, we applied systematic techniques to ensure the datasets were suitable for machine learning algorithms. Categorical features, prevalent across all three datasets (e.g., job type in 'Bank', education in 'Credit', and occupation in 'Census'), were encoded using one-hot encoding. This method transforms categorical variables into a series of binary columns, one for each category, thereby preventing the model from erroneously assuming ordinal relationships among categories and enabling effective numerical processing. Numerical features, such as age or bill amounts, were normalized using standardized scaling, a process that centers the data around a mean of zero and scales it to unit variance. This normalization ensures that features with differing scales contribute equally to the model’s learning process, which is particularly critical for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes, such as those relying on gradient-based optimization.

Each dataset was provided with pre-partitioned training and testing sets by their respective data providers, ensuring an initial separation for model training and evaluation on unseen data. To align with our experimental design, which simulates a distributed learning environment, we further processed the training data by splitting it vertically into three distinct parts, each assigned to one of three hypothetical parties: A, B, and C. This vertical partitioning implies that each party holds a unique subset of features for the entire set of instances, reflecting a scenario where data is distributed across multiple entities, as is common in federated learning frameworks. To emulate conditions where labeled data is scarce or unevenly distributed, we removed the data labels from the portions held by parties B and C, thereby generating unlabeled datasets collectively referred to as U. For party A, we identified all instances belonging to the positive class within its training data subset and randomly selected 10% of these instances to retain their labels, forming the positive set P. The labels for the remaining 90% of positive instances, as well as all negative instances, were disregarded in party A’s data, effectively treating these instances as unlabeled within the experiment. Consequently, our experimental setup comprises a small labeled positive set P, accessible only to party A, alongside a larger unlabeled set U distributed across all three parties, enabling us to investigate our method’s ability to leverage limited labeled data in a distributed context.

在我们的实验中，我们利用了三个多样且成熟的数据集来评估我们所提出方法的有效性：Bank Marketing Dataset\footnote{\label{bank}\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing}}、Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset\footnote{\sloppy \label{credit}\url{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset}} 以及 Adult Census Dataset\footnote{\label{adult}\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult}}。每个数据集的选择都经过精心考虑，以代表不同的真实世界领域和预测挑战，从而使我们能够在多样化的场景下对我们方法的鲁棒性进行评估。

Bank Marketing Dataset\footnote{\label{bank}\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing}} 源自 UCI 机器学习库，数据来自葡萄牙某银行针对定期存款产品进行的直销电话营销活动。这些活动通过电话直接与客户沟通，旨在说服他们订购定期存款产品。完整的数据集包含四个版本，但在本研究中，我们专门采用了“bank-additional-full”版本，该版本包含 41,188 个样本和 20 个输入特征。这些特征涵盖了客户的各种属性，包括年龄、工作类型、婚姻状况、教育程度以及诸如是否有住房贷款或个人贷款等金融细节，同时也包括了营销活动相关变量，如联系次数和以往互动的结果。数据按照日期顺序排列，涵盖了从 2008 年 5 月到 2010 年 11 月的时间段，反映了此期间营销工作的时间演变。该数据集的主要分类目标是预测客户是否会订购定期存款，即由变量“y”（是/否）表示的二元结果。此数据集在客户关系管理方面具有实际意义，并且由于大多数客户并未订购，从而带来了类别不平衡的问题，这为预测建模带来了实际挑战。

Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset\footnote{\sloppy \label{credit}\url{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset}} 来自 Kaggle，提供了有关台湾 30,000 名信用卡客户财务行为的详尽数据，数据集中包含 24 个变量。这些变量融合了丰富的人口统计信息（如性别、教育、婚姻状况和年龄）和详细的还款历史数据，涵盖了每月账单、前期还款金额以及多个月份内的付款延迟记录。该数据集为构建预测模型以评估客户下月违约风险提供了基础，其目标变量为表示违约状态（是/否）的二元指标。人口统计和交易特征的结合为信用风险提供了细致的视角，使该数据集在金融分析中极具价值。其庞大的数据量和详细的特征集进一步提升了其在训练和评估旨在信用风险预测的复杂机器学习模型中的适用性。

Adult Census Dataset\footnote{\label{adult}\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult}} 同样源自 UCI 机器学习库，是一个广泛认可的人口统计和社会经济数据集，数据来自 1994 年美国人口普查。该数据集包含各种属性，如年龄、工作类别（例如私人部门、联邦政府）、教育程度、职业、种族、性别、资本利得、资本损失、每周工作小时数以及原籍国，为个人特征提供了详尽的快照。数据集的分类任务是预测个人年收入是否超过 50,000 美元，这一二元结果已成为收入预测模型的基准。除了在机器学习中的应用之外，该数据集还经常被研究人员和从业者用于探讨与收入分配、就业趋势和经济差异相关的社会模式。其多样的特征集和现实意义使其成为评估预测模型的理想候选者，同时也应对了诸如缺失值和类别数据处理等挑战。为简洁起见并在本文中保持一致性，我们分别将这些数据集称为“Bank”、“Credit”和“Census”。

在数据预处理阶段，我们采用了系统化技术以确保数据集适用于机器学习算法。所有三个数据集中普遍存在的分类特征（例如“Bank”中的工作类型、“Credit”中的教育程度以及“Census”中的职业）均采用独热编码（one-hot encoding）进行编码。该方法将分类变量转换为一系列二元列，每个列对应一个类别，从而防止模型错误地假设类别之间存在序数关系，并能有效地进行数值处理。数值特征，如年龄或账单金额，则使用标准化缩放方法进行归一化，该方法将数据中心化为均值为零并缩放为单位方差。这种归一化确保了不同尺度的特征在模型学习过程中具有同等的贡献，尤其对于依赖梯度优化的算法尤为关键。

各数据集均由各自数据提供方预先划分为训练集和测试集，确保模型训练与在未见数据上的评估有初步的分离。为了与我们的实验设计保持一致，该设计模拟了分布式学习环境，我们进一步将训练数据纵向划分为三个不同部分，分别分配给三个假想方：A、B 和 C。该纵向划分意味着每个方持有整个样本集中的一部分独特特征，这反映了数据在多个实体间分布的场景，正如联邦学习框架中常见的情况。为模拟标签数据稀缺或分布不均的情况，我们从方 B 和 C 持有的数据中移除了数据标签，从而生成了统称为 U 的未标记数据。对于方 A，我们在其训练数据子集中识别出所有属于正类的样本，并随机选择其中 10% 的样本保留其标签，构成正样本集 P。而对于其余 90% 的正样本以及所有负样本，其标签均被忽略，在方 A 的数据中这些样本实际上被视为未标记。因此，我们的实验设置由仅供方 A 使用的一小部分标记正样本集 P，以及分布于三个方的更大未标记数据集 U 组成，从而使我们能够探讨我们方法在分布式环境下利用有限标记数据的能力。
